# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to complete this webpage, not only because it was classwork, but I wanted to relearn web development from past education experiences with this bootcamp, as well as learn new knowledge and skills for the future. Not only did it help refresh my knowledge of "basic" skills like HTML, CSS, and Javascript (which I struggled with in the past, but was explained in such a way I better understood), but I also learned how to use Git and GitHub, as well as Command Line - not even the degree program I attended in the past covered that!

I won't lie. There were a few hiccups during this process. Firstly, during the first lesson covering HTML, I did a couple things not instructed in the lessons, going off of prompts in either GitHub or Visual Studio Code, and so couldn't fully commit with the completed HTML part. I ended up having to delete almost everything and restart from scratch to get it right. Then the Javascript ended up being the most difficult, in just commiting it. For some reason, things weren't committing in Git, and so with trying to correct it to get it to commit, and reverting on those, the script.js file ended up getting deleted by mistake and I ended up having to redo that. However, I got past these challenges and I definitely learned valuable information going forward.

While this is my first project, and may seem rough around the edges, it definitely gave me a platform to leap from with what I can better expect for future lessons, as well as a possible future career as a Full Stack Developer and working with others to complete projects far more diverse and intense.

I can't wait.

## Usage

I made sure to add notes for each topic; covering HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. You'll also notice that when you open the DevTools Console, the Javascript will be seen running. This prework goes through what was learned for each topic.
