# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to complete this webpage, not only because it was classwork, but I wanted to relearn web development from past education experiences with this bootcamp, as well as learn new knowledge and skills for the future. Not only did it help refresh my knowledge of "basic" skills like HTML, CSS, and Javascript (which I struggled with in the past, but was explained in such a way I better understood), but I also learned how to use Git and GitHub, as well as Command Line - not even the degree program I attended in the past covered that!

While this is my first project, and may seem rough around the edges, it definitely gave me a platform to leap from with what I can better expect for future lessons, as well as a possible future career as a Full Stack Developer and working with others to complete projects far more diverse and intense.

I can't wait.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I made sure to add notes for each topic; covering HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. You'll also notice that when you open the DevTools Console, the Javascript will be seen running.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
